MyBarsik is an Android application that was built for the course Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing at Nazarbayev University.

Do you remember the tamagotchi toys that we used to have in our childhood? Well, this app is very similar! You will have a pet snow leopard (national animal of Kazakhstan) and will need to take care of it by earning points while doing exercise, like running, push-ups, etc. Your pet will show how he's in a bad mood when he's hungry, or how he gets happy when he is fed! He can even go to sleep and do other activities. This app will send notifications to you when an action needs to be taken in order to make Barsik happy.
