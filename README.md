This is an Android Application called MyBarsik, which was built as a result of the course Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing at Nazarbayev University.

Do you remember tamagotchi toys that we used to have in our childhood? Well, this app is very similar, you will have a pet which is snow leopard (main symbol of Kazakhstan), and you need to take care of your pet by earning some points while doing exercises, like running, push-ups, etc. Our pet shows how he's in a bad mood when he's hungry, or how he gets happy when he was fed, he can also go to sleep and do other activities. This app sends notifications to the user when an action needs to be taken in order to make the pet happy.
